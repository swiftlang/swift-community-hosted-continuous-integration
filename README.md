# Swift Community-Hosted Continuous Integration

[Swift Community-Hosted CI](https://ci-external.swift.org) is an extension of Swift CI that allows the community to add additional platforms. Community members can volunteer to host new platforms and they are responsible for maintaining the host nodes. The maintainer will provide a build preset which will be periodically built on the node. This allows the Swift community to see the impact of changes on a greater range of platforms.

## Current List of Nodes
   * Fedora 35
   * Fedora Rawhide
   * ARMv7 for Debian "Stretch"
   * Ubuntu 16.04
   * Ubuntu 18.04 for TensorFlow
   * PPC64LE for Ubuntu 16.04
   * Android
   * macOS 10.13 for TensorFlow
   * wasm32 cross-compiled from Ubuntu 20.04


## Add Nodes

1. Create a pull request 
    * Add new JSON file under nodes directory -  nodes/<platform>_<os_version>.json

```json
{
   "contact":{
      "name":"Full name",
      "email":"Email address",
      "company":"Company name (optional)"
   },
   "node":{
      "platform":"Platform name",
      "os_version":"Operating system version"
   },
   "jobs":[
      {
         "display_name":"Swift - <PLATFORM> (Tools <TOOLS_CONFIG>, Stdlib <STDLIB_CONFIG>) (<BRANCH>))",
         "branch":"Swift branch",
         "preset":"Build preset from utils/build-preset.ini"
      }
   ]
}
```

Example:
File name: macOS_10_13.json

```json
{
   "contact":{
      "name":"Mishal Shah",
      "email":"example@apple.com",
      "company":"Apple Inc"
   },
   "node":{
      "platform":"macOS",
      "os_version":"macOS 10.13"
   },
   "jobs":[
      {
         "display_name":"Swift - macOS (Tools RA, Stdlib RD) (master)",
         "branch":"master",
         "preset":"buildbot_incremental,tools=RA,stdlib=RD,build"
      }
   ]
}
```

2. Verify preset builds on the server:
    * Clone Swift 
      `git clone https://github.com/apple/swift.git`
    * Clone all other repositories 
      `./swift/utils/update-checkout --scheme <BRANCH> --clone`
    * Build + Test
      `./swift/utils/build-script --preset=<PRESET>`

3. Once the pull request has been merged, you will receive an email with a set of terms and conditions to agree to, and to exchange public key information for connecting to the CI system.

4. You will be required to provide the following information in the email:
    * Agreement to terms and conditions
    * IP address
    * Username

## Maintaining Node

The node maintainer is responsible for updating the OS with security patches, keeping the host online, and installing any required packages to build the Swift compiler on the node. In the event that the host node becomes unaccessible or offline, the maintainer is responsible for bringing the node online within two weeks of being notified. Otherwise, an un-maintained node may be removed from the CI.

## Contributing

Welcome to the Swift community!

Contributions to Swift's community hosted continuous integration are welcomed and encouraged! Please see the [Contributing to Swift guide](swift.org/contributing) and check out the [structure of the community](https://www.swift.org/community/#community-structure).

To be a truly great community, Swift needs to welcome developers from all walks of life, with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of experience. A diverse and friendly community will have more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produce more great code. We will work diligently to make the Swift community welcoming to everyone.

To give clarity of what is expected of our members, Swift has adopted the code of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant. This document is used across many open source communities, and we think it articulates our values well. For more, see the [Code of Conduct](https://www.swift.org/code-of-conduct/).
